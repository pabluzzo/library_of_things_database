- Date of entry: 13-05-2025
- What I’ve worked on: Creating a basic version of my database's schema, reading tkinter documentation to get started.
- What problems I encountered: I couldn't install cs50's library with conda, so I found out python has an sqlite3 library by default.
- What I learned:
- Which resources did I use: tkdocs.com

- Date of entry: 18-05-2025
- What I’ve worked on: Developed basic functions to interact with the database. Developed a basic command line interface to quickly test my functions.
- What problems I encountered: Some functions would not work, database would get locked.
- What I learned: I learned how to use the python SQL library some more, as I wrongly assumed the syntax was the same as cs50's and that's why my code was not working. It was also my first time creating a command line interface.
- Which resources did I use: python3 sqlite3 library, stackoverflow, https://medium.com/@abelzerihun/understanding-parameterized-queries-3c4d81acbf41.

- What I’ve worked on: Making a tkinter interface for browsing and editing the database. For now, only widgets with no functionalities yet.
- What problems I encountered: Biggest problem was that the few widgets that referred to variables would not display those values. ChatGPT gave me some ideas for debugging. Turns out, it had to do with multiple tkinter windows being nested into one another. I solved it by assigning the appropriate object type of the second window from Tk() to Toplevel().
- What I learned: How to make a basic tkinter interface: buttons, labels, dividers, grid management.
- Which resources did I use: tkdocs.com & pythonguides.com for tkinter basics. ChatGPT for debugging, but not for writing the code itself.
